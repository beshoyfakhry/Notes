A simple application for notes that help in saving the note local and give each note a certain color

## In this branch you'll find:

1. User Interface built with Jetpack Compose
2. A single-activity architecture, using Navigation Compose.
3. A presentation layer that contains a Compose screen (View) and a ViewModel per screen
4. A data layer with a repository and data sources (local using Room).
5. A domain layer with use cases and interfaces.
6. Reactive UIs using Flow and coroutines for asynchronous operations.
7. Dependency injection using Hilt.
 
## Why Note-App?
The app in this project aims to be simple enough that you can understand it quickly, but complex enough to showcase difficult design decisions. 
 
## Who is it for?
1.  Intermediate developers and beginners looking for a way to structure their app in a testable and maintainable way.
2.  Advanced developers looking for quick reference.
